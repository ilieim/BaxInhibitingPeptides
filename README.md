# BaxInhibitingPeptides
Input files for the atomistic simulations presented in: Computational design of Bax-inhibiting peptides, https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.28.617283 
Folders P1, P2 and P3 contain the structures of the complexes in PDB format.
npt.mdp - the mdp file for the NPT equilibration of each system
md.mdp - the mdp file for the NVT production runs
md_pull.mdp - the mdp file for the steered MD step in the umbrella sampling simulations
